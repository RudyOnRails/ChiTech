    <h3>Chicago Tech Academy</h3>
    <p>Chicago Tech Academy (ChiTech), a non-profit, 4-year contract secondary school located in University Village, was founded to inspire, educate and connect the next generation of leaders. ChiTech is helping Chicago businesses reap the benefits of diversity by increasing the number of minority and low income students that pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in college and careers in Chicago. </p>

      Our Mission
    </h3>
    <!-- not sure about this text.... specifically the disadvantaged part -->
    <p>We give disadvantaged kids an opportunity to succeed in ways they previously never dreamed of by doing things differently:
      <li>We accept students from all over Chicago regardless of income.</li>
      <li>We employ Project Based Learning, entrepreneurial principles, one-on-one mentoring, and real world experience through partnerships with real Chicago companies.</li>
      <li>And we are committed to supporting our students from freshman to alumni and beyond.</li>
    </p>

    <h3>
